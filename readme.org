#+type: Activity


* Summary
  Intro activity for console applications using Urwid.

* Objective
  First run through the urwid intro to build a little familiarty with
  the library, then try to complete the main task by end of class.
  
* Requirements
  + Shell terminal
  + ~urwid~, library for console applications
  + Affection for musty old memes!

* Tasks

** ~urwid~ intro

*** Initial setup for activity
    1. Set up enviornment
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
         mkdir urwid; cd urwid
         virtualenv -p python3 env/
         env/bin/python -m pip install urwid
         touch scratch.py
       #+END_SRC

    2. Add the following to your scratch.py file
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         import urwid

         markup = "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US"

         # instantiate application widgets
         txt = urwid.Text(markup)

         # instantiate "topmost" widget container
         fill = urwid.Filler(txt, 'middle')

         # instantiate application loop
         app = urwid.MainLoop(fill)

         app.run()
       #+END_SRC

    3. Run your scratch file with ~env/bin/python scratch.py~. Success?
       Success! close the program with ~Ctrl-c~.

    4. notes
       + ~txt~ is the instantiation of the ~urwid.Text()~[[http://urwid.org/reference/widget.html#text][(doc)]] widget.

       + ~urwid.Filler()~[[http://urwid.org/reference/widget.html#filler][(doc)]] is called the "topmost" widget. It is
         the main container that holds all the application widgets.

         - The second argument, ~'middle'~ is the vertical alignment
           optional argument, the docs show that ~'middle'~ is the
           default and there are three other possible settings.

       + ~urwid.MainLoop()~ is an object class that handles the main
         application loop, the 'topmost' widget is passed as the only
         argument in this example.

*** Global Interupt
    1. Lets make the application quit in a more user friendly way by
       adding a key interupt to exit the application. Create the
       following function definition above your widgets.
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         def exit_on_q(key):
             if key in ('q', 'Q'):
                 raise urwid.ExitMainLoop()
       #+END_SRC
    2. now lets add the ~exit_on_q~ function to the instantiation of
       our ~MainLoop()~
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         loop = urwid.MainLoop(fill, unhandled_input=exit_on_q)
       #+END_SRC
    3. notes
       + The ~unhandled_input~ optional in MainLoop() handles all
         other events not managed by the application widgets. in this
         case, our only widget does not handle any events.

*** Display Attributes and Decoration Widgets
    1. Lets create a ~palette~ for our small application. A palette is
       python list of ~Attributes~. Each attribute is usually a tuple
       of strings of the form:
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         ('your_attribute_name', 'foreground_color', 'background_color' )
       #+END_SRC
       Add the following above your widgets:
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         palette = [('banner', 'black', 'light gray'),
                    ('streak', 'black', 'dark red'),
                    ('background', 'black', 'dark blue')]
       #+END_SRC
    2. Decoration Widgets are special widgets that wrap our
       application widgets. so many widgets! We will use the
       Decoration Widget ~urwid.AttrMap()~ [[http://urwid.org/reference/widget.html#attrmap][(docs)]]. This wraps our application
       widgets with our pre-defined attributes from our ~palette~.
       update your scratch application with the following starting
       with ~markup~:
       #+BEGIN_SRC python
         markup = ('banner', "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US")

         txt = urwid.Text(markup, align='center')
         txt_with_color_band = urwid.AttrMap(txt, 'streak')
         fill = urwid.Filler(txt_with_color_band)
         decorated_fill = urwid.AttrMap(fill, 'background')
         loop = urwid.MainLoop(decorated_fill, palette, unhandled_input=exit_on_q)

         loop.run()
       #+END_SRC
    3. Play around with this for a bit and try to build up an
       intuition about how things are working. If you wish to change
       colors the key words can be found in the docs [[http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#foreground-background][here]].


*** Show me what you got!
    All ur widgets! They belong to us! Build us something interesting
    based on the classic meme, "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US". We
    suggest you be mindful of the process you are using to design your
    application. It might be helpful to apply something like the
    "informal process" discussed previously.

    YOu mUst satisfy our tHirst for humOr and mehmehs or else!
